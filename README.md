# OpenEP_Exercise

Dear Candidate,

Here, we would like to ask you to do a take-home exercise and present the results during the interview. A powerpoint template with detailed explanations of the results we expected during the interview is provided in this repository. 

The excersie entails 4 steps:

**Step 1** - Download and install the software package called "OpenEp-py" from the following github repository:
             https://github.com/openep/openep-py. Please make sure all dependencies are installed properly.
         
**Step 2** - Try to read the dataset provided in this repository using openep-py library in python. Present the mean of all electrodes bi-                     polar voltages and total atrial activation time in a table (see slide 2 of the powerpoint template).

**Step 3** - Using the data you read in the previous step and the code (CV.py) presented in this repository, generate bi-polar voltage and                     conduction velocity maps. Make a snapshot of each map and present them in a similar way shown in the slide 3 of the powerpoint                    template.  

**Step 4** - Design a very simple graphical user interface using pyQT library with a drop-down menu (see slide 4 of the powerpoint template). The              menu should contain two options, voltage and conduction velocity. By selecting each option it should visualise the corresponding                  map. 

Please make sure your code is ready to be executed during the interview. 

**Bonus Task:** Provide suggestions how the CV.py code could be improved. 

**Good luck **
