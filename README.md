# OpenEP_Exercise

Dear Candidate,

Here, we would like to ask you to do a take-home exercise and present the results during the interview. 

The excersie entails 4 steps:

**Step 1** - Download and install the software package called "OpenEp-py" from the following github repository:
         https://github.com/openep/openep-py. 
         
**Step 2** - Try to read the dataset provided in this repository using openep-py library in python and present the mean of bi-polar voltages of all 
             electrodes. 

**Step 3** - Calculate the conduction velocity map using the data you read in the previous step and the code (CV.py) in this repository.

**Step 4** - Design a very simple graphical user interface with pyQT library, with a drop-down menu contains voltage and conduction velocity maps                  as choices and visualise the corresponding map.

**Bonus Task:** Some part of the CV.py code is written in a clumsy way, try to improve it. 

Please let us know if you need more time to complete this task. We may postpone the interview appointment.

**Good luck **
